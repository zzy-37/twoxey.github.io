In today’s experience supremacy, people pay more attention to spiritual needs and emotional communication. They are willing to explore the life and the environment, while the Starbucks Coffee Experience Farm provides an ideal pastoral for them.
This project is based on the composting of coffee grounds, combining Starbucks with the nearby landscape space into a sustainable organic system.
Meanwhile, reshaping the green humanistic space provides a vigorous public activity platform for the urban crowd. Through the organization of experiential activities, the urban planting culture becomes the medium of community construction, and links the brand and users better.
