Camping is an outdoor sport that is close to nature. Based on "Nature - Art", this project aims to make more people understand camping and X-Camping through art.
By using both the design of the camp space and the community services, it provides a platform for users, artists and local villagers to co-create the camp. It creates a lifestyle proposal and camping experience that allows users to experience nature and an artistic atmosphere.
I hope to attract more people to try living close to nature through art that has been integrated into everyday life, so that the concept of being close to nature and respecting nature can be integrated into people's real life.
