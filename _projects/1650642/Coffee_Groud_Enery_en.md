When we think about the link between consumer behavior and the green economy, we can see that, on the one hand, current consumption rules do not require consumers to take responsibility for the "garbage" that consumer behavior brings, and on the other hand, social technology is trying to convert the remaining "garbage" of consumption into energy.
"Coffee Ground Energy Station Program" through the design intervention of installation, interaction and etc. to stimulate consumers' attention on where the "garbage after consumption  - coffee ground" goes and "garbage" efficacy. At the same time, it suggests brands provide "energy" support to specific resource producers, so as to benefit these three types of stakeholders, while trying to solve the contradiction between human consumption and the natural environment.
