In the definition of sustainability, extending the  life cycle of product is an effective way to achieve the goal of sustainability. In this project, I will take Shanghai Starbucks Reserve™ coffee beans as an example to discuss the sustainable life cycle story of coffee beans.
In the form of cascading long rolls, the installation records the scenes of different stages in the life cycle of coffee beans with different materials.
From the longitudinal reading, you can know the life cycle of coffee beans through layers of materials. If you look at the material description of each layer , you can understand the sustainable story of coffee beans in different life stages.
