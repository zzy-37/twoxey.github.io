Nowadays, the pace of life is faster, many urban young people are plagued by negative emotions. By analyzing their stress situation and the characteristics of the camping industry, I hope to innovate a new form of healing which is close to nature for urban young people. Due to the quiet nature environment and interesting healing activities, anxious users can improve their inner spirituality to deal with emotional problems more effectively. The project will design the camp space and related activities with a healing orientation, so as to make up for the pain points of the healing market and enrich the content of the camping market, thus promoting the integration of the two industries.
