Today's luxury campsites are not only focused on creating a spatial environment, but also gradually on human interaction and scenario building to promote camping culture and camping spirit.
Even for the novice camper, dining is a typical activity and a necessary part of the camping experience.
I have therefore combined the camp's local resources to design an enhanced camp dining experience, creating a fun environment for meal preparation and dining, and allowing visitors to realise and participate in collaborative efforts to experience and practise the spirit of the outdoors.
