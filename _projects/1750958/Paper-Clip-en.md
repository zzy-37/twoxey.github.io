Sustainable design is becoming more and more important for social development. If sustainable design is adopted to promote social development, environmental damage and pollution will be greatly reduced. If people don't know about sustainable design, then sustainable development will never happen. Then it becomes extremely important to have a strategy for demonstrating and relaying the results of sustainable design.
I plan to build a platform to show sustainable design, to show the relevant achievements of D&I on sustainable design, so that different people can find the information and ideas of sustainable design in relevant industries more efficiently, and make sustainable design more widely disseminated.
