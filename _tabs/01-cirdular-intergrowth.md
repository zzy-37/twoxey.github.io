人类活动所引发的气候变化、工业生产所导致的环境污染、物质消费激增下的能源危机……  
半世纪前罗马俱乐部在《增长的极限》一书中的“危言耸听”如今均已成为迫在眉睫的现实难题。世间万物的循环流动，人与自然的平衡共生，设计师应如何将“循环”与“共生”的理念付诸实践？  
从材料实验到模式创新，从商业实践到前瞻思辨，“循环共生”板块中的22位毕业生从各自对生态伦理的思考出发，以多样的设计实践，尝试向实现人类与生态环境的永续共存迈出一小步。

Climate change caused by human activities, environmental pollution caused by industrial production, energy crisis caused by the surge in material consumption…  
The alarmist hypotheses in the Limits to Growth by the Club of Rome half a century has all become grim reality. How should designers put the concept of “circulation” of the material world and “intergrowth” between human and nature into practice?  
From material experiment to modal innovation, from business practice to forward speculation, 22 graduates in the “Circular Intergrowth” session start from their respective thinking on ecological ethics, and try to take a small step further towards the sustainable coexistence between human beings and the ecological environment through various design practices.
